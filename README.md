Cryptograms
===========

Application to automatically solve cryptograms

For example: the given encrpted message that's feed to the program is:
"QYZSF OQVXZVXL ZWS ZBJX FSD, ZQAS Q FSHZ MSYBFS QOORPVXL Q HSUBXD UBQZ."

the decrpted message from the program is:
"AFTER PAINTING THE TMWN RED, TAJE A REST BEFMRE APPLYING A SECMND CMAT."

the actual message is:
"After painting the town red, take a rest before applying a second coat."


Depending on the complexity of the message feed to the program, the solver may or may not find the correct decrption code. The program is currently set to run for 1 minute, then return the best code found available.
